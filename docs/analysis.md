# analysis.go

## Responsibility
The `analysis.go` file contains the core logic for determining whether a given domain or URL is running on Shopify's platform by analyzing the website's content.

## Structure

1. **Package Declaration**: Part of the `main` package.

2. **Import Section**: Imports packages for I/O operations, logging, HTTP requests, URL parsing, and string manipulation.

3. **Main Analysis Function**:
   - `analyzeDomain(input string)`: Performs the Shopify detection analysis on a given domain.
     - Extracts a valid domain from the input
     - Logs the start of the analysis process
     - Makes an HTTP request to the domain
     - Reads the response body
     - Searches for Shopify indicators in the HTML content
     - Logs the results of the analysis

## Opportunities for Abstraction

1. **Analysis Strategy Pattern**: Implement different detector strategies to identify Shopify stores.

2. **HTTP Client Configuration**: Extract HTTP client setup to a shared utility.

3. **Result Processing**: Separate the analysis logic from result recording.

4. **Indicator Detection**: Create a more sophisticated detector that can handle different types of Shopify implementations.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement more granular error types for different failure scenarios.

6. **Asynchronous Processing**: Enhance the background processing capabilities with proper queuing and status tracking.
