# main.go

## Responsibility
The `main.go` file serves as the application's entry point and is responsible for initializing the server, setting up the database, and configuring HTTP routes.

## Structure

1. **Package Declaration**: Declares the `main` package, making this file the application's entry point.

2. **Import Section**: Imports necessary packages for logging and HTTP handling.

3. **Main Function**: 
   - Initializes the database connection
   - Creates the events table if it doesn't exist
   - Sets up HTTP routes with pattern matching:
     - `/favicon.png` -> Serves the favicon
     - `/status/` -> Checks analysis status
     - `/{domain}` -> Shows analysis results for a domain
     - `/` -> Serves landing page and processes URL submissions
   - Starts the HTTP server on port 8080

## Opportunities for Abstraction

1. **Configuration Handling**: Move hardcoded values (like the port number) to a configuration system.

2. **Server Initialization**: Extract server setup into a separate function to improve testability.

3. **Route Registration**: Create a dedicated function for route setup to make the code more modular.

4. **Middleware Support**: Implement middleware capabilities for cross-cutting concerns like logging and error handling.
